# Digital-Sensor-Controlled-Piano-with-lights-Musical-Staircase-
WORKING :
Musical staircase is basically an interactive interface which 
sounds with different tones when you step on stairs one by 
one.
Here the led light strips are arranged on each step along with 
a IR sensors. When a person steps on it the motion is 
detected by the IR sensor and this message is passed on to 
the Arduino and in the Arduino different tones are set for 
different steps, and the tone corresponding to each sensor is 
passed on to the speaker simultaneously with the 
corresponding led strips through a relay module

Components required :
Arduino Uno 
Relay module 
IR Module 
LED strip 
Connecting wires
